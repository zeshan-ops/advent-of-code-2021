# Day 4 Squid Game Documentation

## Blah blah blah
This one took a while. The program accepts input without blank lines. And the input data must have only single spaces
between integers. I did this because it was faster to clean the data and get it into that form than it was to write code
that would deal with the input file as given by AoC.

The delimiter doesn't matter, you just change it on lines 131 and 112 as needed.

The code in its current form only solves part two of the problem. Again, it was quicker for me to change the code that solved
part 1 than to write extra code so it would solve both parts. Bad coding practice but it is what it is.
