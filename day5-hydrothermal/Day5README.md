## How hydrothermal-venture.cpp should be run
When running the file, you must give it an input file, dimensions of the grid on which the calculations are to be done (e.g. 10 for the test case, 1000 for the actual problem input file), and the problem part number you wish to solve.

The format for these is as follows:
input file command: -i "filename"
grid dimensions: -d DIMENSION
problem part: -part PARTNUMBER

where dimension is any integer and PARTNUMBER must be 1 or 2.

There's a CMD line option for help (-h) that it'll accept but i havent actually added anything, itll just print out "no help text implemented" or smth like that
