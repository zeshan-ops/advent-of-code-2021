# Day 6 Lanternfish

## Part 1
- I think we can just read the input into a vector, push_back cuz the vector will keep getting bigger each time new lanternfish is spawned
- update the vector according to a set of rules as given by the problem description
- after 80 updates, vector.size() is the answer. bish bash bosh
